# Thinking process

### Preparation
when I first got the code test, my think process:
1. which public api should use: after a research, I choosed `weatherstack`
2. as we need to support accessbility, use `axe-core/react` will help me on the code
3. use UI pacakge `material ui` for quick layout design
